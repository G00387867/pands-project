#  Fisherâ€™s Iris data set

## *_Introduction_*

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: *_the length and the width of the sepals and petals_*, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other[1].
