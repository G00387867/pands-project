#  Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset

### _Introduction_

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: **_the length and the width of the sepals and petals_**, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other[1].

The aim for this project is to analyse the Fisher's Iris flower dataset using python as a coding and scripting language.

### _Methodology_

* Downloading iris data set from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris and saving it to this repository [2]
* Assigning columns to raw data with each variable attribute: petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and type.
* Analysing the data by creating a histogram of each variable and text file summary of the statistical specification of the variable.
* Using seaborn library to create a plot showing the corelation between the different variable categories.
